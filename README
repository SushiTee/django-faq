====================================================================
 Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) management for Django applications
====================================================================

This application provides the ability to create and manage topics
and lists of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) in Django_ applications.

.. _Django: http://www.djangoproject.com/


TODO
====

* Document change of modified date field behavior. (Drop null=True, now have a
    date upon creation.) Write migration if necessary.
* Write tests
* Write documentation
* Bump version
* Write Question inline admin ordering JavaScript

* Consider if/how-to add ordering to Topics (complicated because of site relations)
* Add “Ask a question” feature. (Or not. Maybe this would be easier for them
  to template in a contact form.)
* Write slug-based template loading for topics. (And questions within topics.)

* Make question slug unique *for the topic*. (Except maybe not, because the
    way shallow URLs are currently templated requires complete uniqueness.)
    unique_together in the model’s meta class could handle this (though the
    error message is not as graceful as I would like) except that an exception
    is thrown when a question is an inline (like with a topic, as is the most
    common way to handle questions).
    Also, consider if migration is needed, seeing how unique constraint will be
    removed from the slug field.


When dropping Django 1.2 support
--------------------------------

* Update to class-based generic views
